    "dsc": "In this practice driving environment, speeds range between 55 to 70 mph. Ideally, the teen driver should learn how to drive safely on the highway with a driver’s ed instructor before practicing with a parent. Usually, driving on 3-lane highways with paved shoulders is easier than 2-lane highways without paved shoulders. Begin these highway driving lessons during the day with dry pavement and no adverse weather. Avoid practicing at night, during rush hour."

While the roads in your home country are open to you whenever the need to drive so takes hold of you, those travelling to another country on business or holiday are often unable to rent a car or drive since they do not have a license that is accepted in that country."

    "dec": "Automatic gearboxes are being specified on all types of car in greater numbers than ever before, and there’s a long list of reasons for buyers to choose one over an old-fashioned manual. For starters, if it’s relaxing progress you’re after, perhaps in a prestigious luxury car, an automatic can provide added smoothness with gear changes that are almost imperceptible. Today, a luxury car with a manual gearbox is virtually unthinkable – you can’t choose one in a Mercedes S-Class, Audi A8 or BMW 7 Series and neither Bentley nor Rolls-Royce have offered one for generations."
